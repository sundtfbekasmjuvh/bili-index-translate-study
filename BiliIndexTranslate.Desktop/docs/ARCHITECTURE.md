# Architecture

## Boundaries

| Concern | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Selection observation | `App/Uia/UiaSelectionReader`, `App/Uia/UiaObserver` | UI Automation only. Focused element + ≤6 ancestors, `TextPattern.GetSelection()`, `GetText(max+1)`, `GetBoundingRectangles()`. No tree walks, no clipboard. |
| Input triggers | `App/Input/InputHookThread` | `WH_MOUSE_LL` / `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` on their own STA thread. Classify and post; never block, never swallow input (except wheel events over our own card). Optional `RegisterHotKey`. |
| Source-app tracking | `App/Tracking/SourceWindowTracker` | WinEvents filtered to the source pid (location, move/size, scrolling, minimize) + global foreground hook + 200 ms sanity tick. |
| Selection geometry | `Core/Selection/SelectionAnchor`, `Core/Selection/PopupPlacer`, `Core/Geometry/*` | Physical pixels end to end; per-monitor scale only for gap/margins/limits. Pure functions, unit-tested. |
| Popup lifecycle | `Core/Session/ReadingSession` (decides) + `App/AppHost` (executes) + `App/Popup/PopupPresenter` (window) | Event → effects state machine; every async thing carries an id. |
| Translation requests | `Core/Translation/*` | `EndpointResolver`, `PromptBuilder`, `DeeplxProtocol`, `CustomApiProtocol`, `OpenAiCompatibleTranslator`, `HttpTranslationTransport`, `TranslationCoordinator`. |
| Caching | `Core/Translation/TranslationCache` | LRU 500 / TTL 24 h, in-memory only. Key = text + target + model + effective endpoint + prompt version + source language. In the DeepLX format the model and the glossary are not part of the key, and the endpoint part is the URL as entered (the key is never in it). |
| Settings | `Core/Settings/*`, `App/Native/DpapiSecretProtector`, `App/Settings/SettingsWindow` | JSON + DPAPI blob, tolerant load, clamped ranges, schema migration. |
| Diagnostics | `Core/Diagnostics/*`, `App/Diagnostics/DiagnosticsWindow` | 300-entry ring buffer, p50/p95 per timing category, per-app compatibility registry. |
| Tray / lifetime | `App/Tray/TrayIcon`, `App/Program`, `App/AppHost` | Single instance (mutex + named event), explicit shutdown, ordered disposal. |

## Threads

* **UI thread** (WPF dispatcher): `ReadingSession`, effect execution, popup windows, tray, WinEvent
  callbacks, timers (stabilization, probe watchdog 2.5 s, refresh watchdog 1 s, geometry grace 400 ms).
* **uia-observer** (MTA): the only thread that touches UI Automation. `CUIAutomation8` with
  `ConnectionTimeout` 1500 ms / `TransactionTimeout` 2000 ms, event coalescing and connection
  recovery when available. Work arrives through three *latest-wins* slots (probe, refresh,
  focus re-subscription). A stalled provider blocks only this thread; the UI watchdog reports the
  probe as failed and ignores the late answer. No replacement threads are ever created.
* **input-hooks** (STA): low-level hooks + hotkey message loop. Callbacks only read a struct and
  post to the UI thread.
* **Thread pool**: HTTP via one long-lived `HttpClient` (`SocketsHttpHandler`, pooled connection
  lifetime 10 min), concurrency bounded to 2, 20 s timeout per request, per-request `CancellationTokenSource`.

## State model

`Idle → SelectionPending → Loading → ShowingTranslation | ShowingError`, plus `Dismissed`
(hidden by the user or by loss of context; remembers the dismissed text + source so the same
selection stays quiet until it changes or clears).

Events: `TriggerReceived(MouseUp|KeyUp|UiaEvent|Hotkey)`, `StabilizationElapsed(timerId)`,
`ProbeCompleted(probeId, outcome)`, `TranslationCompleted(requestId, outcome)`,
`GeometryRefreshed(selectionId, update)`, `GeometryGraceElapsed`, `OutsideClick`, `EscapePressed`,
`ForegroundChanged(isSourceOrPopup)`, `SourceWindowLost`, `UserRetry`, `UserClosed`, `UserPinned`,
`SettingsChanged`, `Shutdown`.

Effects: timers, `RequestProbe`, `ShowLoading`, `StartTranslation`, `CancelTranslation`,
`ShowTranslation`, `ShowError`, `HidePopup(reason)`, `Begin/EndTracking`, `UpdateAnchor`,
`Start/CancelGeometryGrace`, `DetachPopup`, `Report`.

Rules that make it race-free:

* Timers, probes, translation requests and selections all have monotonically increasing ids issued
  by the session; anything that completes with a stale id is a no-op (tested).
* Selecting B while A is loading cancels A's request and starts B; A's late result cannot render.
* Dismissal (outside click, Esc, close, foreground change, source lost, geometry lost) cancels the
  in-flight request; a late result cannot reopen the card.
* Cache hits are resolved synchronously inside `StartTranslation`, so `Loading → ShowingTranslation`
  happens within one dispatcher turn (no loading flash).
* The same selection probed again while visible only refreshes the anchor.
* Triggers coalesce: a new trigger restarts the single stabilization timer
  (mouse-up = delay, key-up = +30 ms, UIA event = +70 ms, hotkey = immediate). UIA selection events
  while the left button is held are ignored (mouse-up probes anyway).
* `Shutdown` cancels everything and makes the session inert.

## Popup behaviour

`WS_EX_NOACTIVATE | WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW | WS_EX_TOPMOST`, `ShowActivated=false`, `WM_MOUSEACTIVATE →
MA_NOACTIVATE`, every control `Focusable=False`. The window is reused; content is set, the window
is shown fully transparent, laid out, measured with `GetWindowRect`, placed with `SetWindowPos`
(physical pixels, `SWP_NOACTIVATE`), then faded in over 120 ms. `SizeChanged` re-places. Pinned
cards are detached instances (max 3) with manual drag via `SetWindowPos`.

Placement: horizontally centred on the uppermost visible selected line, 10 logical px above the
selection's union; below the lowest line if there is no room above; clamped to the monitor work
area with an 8 px margin; max width 440 logical px, max height 45 % of the work area, both scaled
per monitor. Mouse wheel over a card is intercepted by the low-level hook and forwarded to the card
so the source document never scrolls underneath it.

## Translation contract

`POST {base}/chat/completions`, `Authorization: Bearer {key}`, JSON body with a system prompt
(preserve meaning, tone, punctuation, line breaks; output only the translation; treat the text
strictly as content) and the selection as the user message, `stream: false`, `temperature 0.2`.
Response text is read from `choices[0].message.content` (string or text-part array). HTML, invalid
JSON, missing/empty content and non-2xx statuses become concise errors with the route
(direct/relay) attached; 412 carries a hint pointing at the relay setting. No retries, no automatic
route changes, no logging of text or keys.

DeepLX format (`apiFormat: Deeplx` in the settings file): `POST` to the endpoint exactly as entered,
with `{apiKey}` replaced by the escaped key (then no `Authorization` header) or, without the
placeholder, `Authorization: Bearer {key}`. Body `{"text", "source_lang", "target_lang"}`; the
translation is `data`. A non-200 `code` inside a 200 response is reported as that HTTP error. There
is no prompt, so the glossary is not applied, and Study Card and image translation fail with a
configuration error before any request is sent. Otherwise the same rules: one request, no retries,
no route changes.

Custom format (`apiFormat: Custom`): the request comes from a template in the settings
(`customMethod`, `customHeaders`, `customBody`) and the endpoint is a template too.
`CustomApiProtocol` fills in `{text}`, `{texts}`, `{apiKey}`, `{target}`, `{targetLang}` and
`{targetLangLower}`, escaping each value for where it lands, and reads the translation at
`customResultPath` (keys, `[n]`, `[*]`). The template is validated completely before anything is
sent; the request goes through `IRawTranslationTransport.SendAsync`, which adds no credential of
its own. The cache key holds a hash of method, headers, body and result path instead of a model.
Study Card and image translation are refused as for DeepLX.
